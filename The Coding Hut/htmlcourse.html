                <h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
                <p>HTML is the main markup language for describing the structure of web pages.</p>
                <img class="poster" src="Images/html.png">

                <p>
                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is the basic building block of World Wide Web.</p>

                <p> Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references to other text
                    that the user can immediately access, usually by a mouse click or key press.

                    </p>


                    <p> Apart from text, hypertext may contain tables, lists, forms, images, and other presentational
                        elements. It is an easy-to-use and flexible format to share information over the Internet.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p> Markup languages use sets of markup tags to characterize text elements within a document, which
                        gives instructions to the web browsers on how the document should appear.<br></p>

                    <p> HTML was originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. He is also known as the father of the
                        web.
                        In 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) became the authority to maintain the HTML
                        specifications. HTML also became an international standard (ISO) in 2000. HTML5 is the latest
                        version of HTML. HTML5 provides a faster and more robust approach to web development.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why to learn HTML ?</h3>
                    <p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
                        headings,
                        paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between
                        researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags
                        available in HTML language.</p>
                    <p>HTML is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer
                        specially
                        when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of
                        learning HTML:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Create Web site - You can create a website or customize an existing web template if you know
                            HTML well.</li>
                        <li>Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML
                            and
                            CSS designing is a must skill.</li>
                        <li>Understand web - If you want to optimize your website, to boost its speed and performance,
                            it is
                            good to know HTML to yield best results.
                            Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML then other related
                            technologies
                            like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand.</li>

                <h1>HTML Get Started</h1>
                <p>An HTML file is simply a text file saved with an .html or .htm extension.</p>
                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p>In this tutorial you will learn how easy it is to create an HTML document or a web page. To begin
                    coding HTML you need only two stuff: a simple-text editor and a web browser.</p>
                <p>Well, let's get started with creating your first HTML page.</p>
                <p>Creating Your First HTML Document Let's walk through the following steps. At the end of this
                    tutorial, you will have made an HTML file that displays "Hello world" message in your web browser.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Steps 1:</strong> Creating the HTML file
                    Open up your computer's plain text editor and create a new file.<br>
                    <br> <strong>Steps 2:</strong>Type some HTML code
                    Start with an empty window and type the following code:
                </p>
                <img src="Images/startcode.png">

                <p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Saving the file
                    Now save the file on your desktop as "myfirstpage.html ".</p>

                <p> To open the file in a browser. Navigate to your file then double click on it. It will open in your
                    default Web browser. If it does not, open your browser and drag the file to it.</p>

                    <h3>Explanation of code</h3>
                    <p>You might think what that code was all about. Well, let's find out.</p>
                    <p>The first line
                        <span>
                            < ! DOCTYPE html>
                        </span>is the document type declaration. It instructs the web browser that this
                        document is an HTML5 document. It is case-insensitive.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <span>
                            < head>
                        </span> element is a container for the tags that provides information about the document, for
                        example, <span>
                            < title>
                        </span>tag defines the title of the document.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <span>
                            < body>
                        </span>element contains the document's actual content (paragraphs, links, images, tables, and so
                        on) that is rendered in the web browser and displayed to the user. You will learn about the
                        different HTML elements in detail in the upcoming chapters. For now, just focus on the basic
                        structure of the HTML document.

                <h1>HTML Elements</h1>
                <p><span>In this tutorial you will learn about HTML tags and elements.</span></p>
                <h3>HTML ELements Syntax</h3>
                <p>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It represents semantics, or meaning.
                    For example, the title element represents the title of the document.</p>
                <p>
                    Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end tag (or closing tag),
                    with content in between. Elements can also contain attributes that defines its additional
                    properties. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the p element, would be written as:
                </p>

            <article id="Attributes">

                <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
                <p><span>In this tutorial you will learn how to use attributes to give more meaning to HTML tags.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>What are Attributes?</h3>
                <p>Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and
                    additional info is placed inside.</p>
                <p>An example of an attribute is:<br>
                    <span>
                        < img src="image path" alt="A pic">
                    </span>
                </p>

                <p>In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the tag.</p>
                <p>HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour.
                    HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default
                    functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to
                    function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.</p>

                    <h3>Core Attributes</h3>
                    <p>The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) are
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ID</li>
                        <li>Title</li>
                        <li>Class</li>
                        <li>Style</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <strong>
                        <p>The Id Attribute:</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page.
                        There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an element − If an
                        element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify just that
                        element and its content. If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style
                        sheet), you can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>The Title Attribute:</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element.The behavior of this attribute will
                        depend upon the element that carries it, although it is often displayed as a tooltip when cursor
                        comes over the element or while the element is loading.</p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>The Class Attribute:</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class
                        of element. You will learn more about the use of the class attribute when you will learn
                        Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). So for now you can avoid it.</p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>The Style Attribute:</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element.

                <h1>HTML Headings</h1>
                <p><span>In this tutorial you will learn how to create headings in HTML.</span></p>
                <h3>Organizing Content with Headings</h3>
                <p>Headings help in defining the hierarchy and the structure of the web page content.</p>
                <p>HTML offers six levels of heading tags,
                    <span>
                        < h1>
                    </span> through <span>
                        < h6>
                    </span>; the higher the heading level number, the greater its importance — therefore <span>
                        < h1>
                    </span>tag
                    defines the most important heading, whereas the <span>
                        < h6>
                    </span>tag defines the least important heading
                    in the document.
                </p>
                <p>By default, browsers display headings in larger and bolder font than normal text. Also,
                    <span>
                        < h1>
                    </span> headings are displayed in largest font, whereas <span>
                        < h6>
                    </span> headings are displayed in smallest font.
                </p>

                <p><span>In this tutorial you will learn how to create headings in HTML.</span></p>
                <h3>Creating Paragraphs</h3>
                <p>Paragraph element is used to publish text on the web pages.</p>
                <p>Paragraphs are defined with the <span>
                        < p>
                    </span> tag. Paragraph tag is a very basic and typically the first tag you will need to publish your
                    text on the web pages.</p>

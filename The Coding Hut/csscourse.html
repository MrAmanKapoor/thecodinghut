                <h1>CSS Introduction</h1>

                <p>CSS is the key presentational technology that is used in website design. </p>
                <img class="poster" src="Images/css.png">

                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a standard style sheet language used for describing the
                    presentation (i.e. the layout and formatting) of the web pages.</p>

                <p> Prior to CSS, nearly all of the presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within
                    the HTML markup (specifically inside the HTML tags); all the font colors, background styles, element
                    alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described within the HTML.

                    </p>


                    <p> As a result, development of the large websites became a long and expensive process, since the
                        style information were repeatedly added to every single page of the website.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>To solve this problem CSS was introduced in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which
                        also maintains its standard. CSS was designed to enable the separation of presentation and
                        content. Now web designers can move the formatting information of the web pages to a separate
                        style sheet which results in considerably simpler HTML markup, and better maintainability.</p>

                    <p>CSS3 is the latest version of the CSS specification. CSS3 adds several new styling features and
                        improvements to enhance the web presentation capabilities. </p>

                <p>CSS is the key presentational technology that is used in website design.</p>
                <h3>Getting started With CSS</h3>
                <p>In this tutorial you'll learn how easy it is to add style and formatting information to the web pages
                    using CSS. But, before we begin, make sure that you have some working knowledge of HTML.</p>
                <h2>Including CSS in HTML Documents.</h2>
                <p>CSS can either be attached as a separate document or embedded in the HTML document itself. There are
                    three methods of including CSS in an HTML document:

                </p>
                <h3>Getting started With CSS Syntax</h3>
                <p>A CSS stylesheet consists of a set of rules that are interpreted by the web browser and then applied
                    to the corresponding elements such as paragraphs, headings, etc. in the document.</p>
                <p>A CSS rule have two main parts, a selector and one or more declarations:<br></p>

                <img class="poster" src="Images/css-syntax.png">



                <p>The selector specifies which element or elements in the HTML page the CSS rule applies to.</p>
                <p>Whereas, the declarations within the block determines how the elements are formatted on a webpage.
                    Each declaration consists of a property and a value separated by a colon (:) and ending with a
                    semicolon (;), and the declaration groups are surrounded by curly braces {}.</p>

                    <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
                    <p><span>CSS is the key presentational technology that is used in website design.</span></p>
                    <h3>What is Selector?</h3>
                    <p>A CSS selector is a pattern to match the elements on a web page. The style rules associated with
                        that selector will be applied to the elements that match the selector pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>Selectors are one of the most important aspects of CSS as they allow you to target specific
                        elements on your web page in various ways so that they can be styled.</p>
                    <h5>Several types of selectors are available in CSS, let's take a closer look at them:</h5><br>
                    <h3>Universal Selector</h3>
                    <p>The universal selector, denoted by an asterisk (*), matches every single element on the page.</p>
                    <p>The universal selector may be omitted if other conditions exist on the element. This selector is
                        often used to remove the default margins and paddings from the elements for quick testing
                        purpose.</p>

                    <p>
                        Let's try out the following example to understand how it basically works:<br>
                        <br>
                        <span> * {<br>
                            margin: 0;<br>
                            padding: 0;<br>
                            }</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The style rules inside the * selector will be applied to every element in a document.</p>

                        <h3>Element Selectors</h3>
                        <p>An element type selector matches all instance of the element in the document with the
                            corresponding element type name. Let's try out an example to see how it actually works:

                            <br> <span> P{<br>
                                Color: blue;<br>
                                }</span>

                        </p>
                        <p>The style rules inside the p selector will be applied on every <span>
                                < p>
                            </span>element (or paragraph) in the document and color it blue, regardless of their
                            position in the document tree.</p><br>
                        <h3>Id Selectors</h3>

                        <p>The id selector is used to define style rules for a single or unique element.</p>
                        <p>The id selector is defined with a hash sign (#) immediately followed by the id value.

                            <span><br><br>

                                #try {<br>
                                color: blue;<br>
                                }
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>This style rule renders the text of an element in blue, whose id attribute is set to try.</p>

                        <h3>Class Selectors</h3>
                        <p>The class selectors can be used to select any HTML element that has a class attribute. All
                            the elements having that class will be formatted according to the defined rule.</p>

                        <p>The class selector is defined with a period sign (.) immediately followed by the class value.

                            <span><br><br>

                                .hello {<br>
                                color: blue;<br>
                                }
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>The above style rules renders the text in blue of every element in the document that has
                            class attribute set to hello. You can make it a bit more particular. For example:
                            <span><br><br>

                                p.hello {<br>
                                color: blue;<br>
                                }
                            </span>

                        </p>
                        <p>The style rule inside the selector p.hello renders the text in blue of only those <span>
                                < p>
                            </span> elements that has class attribute set to hello, and has no effect on other
                            paragraphs.</p>
                    </details>

                    <p><span>CSS is the key presentational technology that is used in website design.</span></p>
                    <h3>Color Property</h3>
                    <p>The color property defines the text color (foreground color in general) of an element.</p>
                    <p>For instance, the color property specified in the body selector defines the default text color
                        for the whole page. Let's try out the following example to see how it works:
                        <span><br><br>

                            body {<br>
                            color: blue;<br>
                            }
                        </span>

                        <h3>Color Keywords</h3>
                        <p>CSS defines the few color keywords which lets you specify color values in an easy way.</p>
                        <p>These basic color keywords are: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy,
                            olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow. The color names are case-insensitive.
                            <br><span><br><br>

                                h1{<br>
                                color: blue;<br>
                                }
                            </span>
                            <br>

                            <span><br><br>

                                p {<br>
                                color: blue;<br>
                                }
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Modern web browsers however practically support many more color names than what are defined
                            in
                            the CSS standard, but to be on the safer side you should use hex color values instead.
                        </p>
                        <h3>HEX Color Values</h3>
                        <p>Hex (short for Hexadecimal) is by far the most commonly used method of defining color on the
                            web.</p>
                        <p>Hex represent colors using a six-digit code, preceded by a hash character, like #rrggbb, in
                            which rr, gg, and bb represents the red, green and blue component of the color respectively
                        </p>
                        <p>The value of each component can vary from 00 (no color) and FF (full color) in hexadecimal
                            notation, or 0 and 255 in decimal equivalent notation. Thus #ffffff represents white color
                            and #000000 represents black color. Let's take a look the following example:
                            <br><span><br><br>

                                h1{<br>
                                color: #00ff00;<br>
                                }
                            </span></p>
                        <h3>RGB Color Values</h3>
                        <p>Colors can be defined in the RGB model (Red, Green, and Blue) using the rgb() functional notation.</p>
                        <p>The following example specifies the same color as in the previous example but in RGB notation.
                            <br><span><br><br>

                                h1{<br>
                                color: rgb(255, 165, 0);<br>
                                }
                            </span></p>
